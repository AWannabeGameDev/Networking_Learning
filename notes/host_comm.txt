To another host on the SAME network :
1. We know the other host is on the same network by looking at its IP, and using a process called subnetting.
Subnetting involves using the subnet mask which tells how big a network is.
We can make the L3 header.
2. We need MAC of other host for L2 header. Use ARP for this.
Send an ARP request as a broadcast - everyone on the network receives
Request has our own IP and MAC, and asks for MAC of other IP
Other IP sends its MAC back with unicast.
3. Both hosts now have each other in their ARP cache
4. Communication can be done easily now.

To another host on a DIFFERENT network :
1. We know the host is on another network via subnetting.
2. L3 header done.
3. This time, we resolve the MAC of the DEFAULT GATEWAY (router) because that is in between are comm. 
4. Data reaches router, router handles this from now on (routing).
