Host : A device that sends or receives traffic over a network
- Client : initiates a request
- Server : responds to a request

IP Address : Address of a host over a network
- xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx (4 8-bit numbers)
- Hierarchical arrangement

Network : Logical grouping of hosts, transports traffic b/w those hosts
Created when hosts are connected.
Owns a particular IP address space
May contain subnetworks.
The internet is just different networks connecting centrally to communicate with each other.

Repeater : Signals across a connection may diminish. Repeater strengthens signal.

Hub : A multiport repeater. Strengthens signals and emits in all other ports
Disadvantage : All data received by and sent to all connected hosts

Bridge : A device between two hubs. Knows which hosts are on which side, and accordingly allows/disallows data through itself.

Switch : Combination of hub and bridge
Allows/disallows data on a per-port basis. Data transmission only happens between hosts that are involved.
Facilitate communication within a network.
Switching : moving data within network

Router : Facilitates communication between networks.
Needed to connect to the internet.
A logical traffic control point (security policies, filtering, redirecting). Usually not needed within a network.
Knows which networks it is connected to -> Routes -> Routing table
Has an IP address in each network it is connected to called default gateway of that network, which is the interface for the network to communicate with other networks.
Create the hierarchies of IP addresses and the internet, since networks communicate with each other via routers. The internet is also just a lot of connected routers. 
Routing : moving data between networks

Other network devices also do some form of switching and routing
